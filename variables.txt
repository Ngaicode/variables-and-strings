Variables are basically like containers which we store value in.
It is the programmer who assigns value to a variable.
A variable's value can be changed and re-assigned at anytime.
A variable's value can be another variable.

VARIABLE NAMING CONVENTIONS
1. A variable name can't start with a number.
2. variable names can consist of letters, numbers or underscores.
3. The most conventional way of naming python variables is in snake_casing which is  done in all lower case.eg variable_one = 123
- The only exception to this rule is when naming is done in all uppercase snake casing, this usually refers to a constant that shouldn't 
interfered with eg THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT  = 3.14
- Another exception is when a variable is named in uppercase camel casing, then it refers to a class (more on that later) 
4. When a variable name starts and ends with underscores, such are called dunder (Double UNDERscores)which means 
that such variables shouldn't be interfered with
